I'm Sebastián Guzmán, a Master's student in Electrical Engineering at Universidad de Chile, passionate about unraveling the mysteries of Deep Learning and Data Science. My journey spans from generative models (like LLMs, VAEs, and diffusion models) to explainable AI (XAI) techniques, always seeking to bridge theory with practical applications. I've worked on diverse projects including fault diagnosis, AI in astronomy, mobile robotics, brain signal analysis (EEG), agricultural optimization using satellite imagery, and intelligent agent development.

Throughout my academic journey, I've undertaken projects using Java, C++, and web technologies, although my primary programming focus is Python, particularly in the context of data science. I have a special interest in electronics, and I enjoy activities like exercising and camping. My goal is to continue pushing my boundaries and, above all, to contribute my energy and knowledge to help those in need.
